<Paragraph>Hi! I'm Matt, and this website is a quick scratchpad I threw together to better demonstrate <Link To="https://blazorise.com">Blazorise</Link> concepts I discuss on <Link To="https://mattjameschampion.com/">my blog</Link>.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Each page generally has an associated blog post that explains what the example is actually doing or what it is trying to achieve. They're not designed to be stand-alone!</Paragraph>
